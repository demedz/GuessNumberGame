## About Guess a Number Game

This game has one of the most innovative gameplays (almost).
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to win a computer.
Computer thinks of a number between 1 and 10 and you have to guess
a number.

Game has 2 game modes: Infinite and Limited.

Infinite - play until you or a computer surrend.
Limited - play until 50 points. Each time you guess right,
you will get 10 points

## Purpose of the game

Main purpose is to train my Java skills.
It is my first project, so it's not complicated. But I do my best to improve it. And one day I will become senior Software Developer.
